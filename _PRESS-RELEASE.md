TEXT2PHONE

A web application for texting website text to your phone.

Good for sending:
  - Addresses
  - Phone-numbers
  - Recipe ingredients for grocery lists 
  - Things you want to remember
  - Any information you want to have available on the go.


I created Text2phone after I started meal-prepping. I found great recipes online but I had no way to capture the ingriedients I needed for my grocerylist without taking a cell-phone picture of the text on the screen... I could not find a better way to transfer web text from my browser to my phone-- so I made one.

Simply create an account with TEXT2PHONE, copy your text into text-field on TEXT2PHONE's homepage, and hit send.

'Wow, text to phone is a life saver, not only do I use it for grocery lists, addresses, and phone-numbers but just last week I lost my phone in my room and was able to send text until I found it. Swaggg!' - The REAL DJ


TEXT2PHONE is free to use, and add free-- check it out @localhost. Happy texting!
